# Description of CS229/CS224N Project

Here you will find a description of our joint project for CS229 
(Machine Learning) and CS224N (Natural Language Processing).

Some preliminary notes for project ideas:

* MATLAB--Neural Network Toolbox
* unlabeled data--raw text
* Neural Networks with word vectors
	* sentiment analysis
	* Twitter data 
	* proliferation of social networks
	* recognize social movements
* Use OpenEdx data (forum posts, questions)
* Global context for determining word similarity distributions


* Identifying internet trolls--through analysis of posts	

* Identifying possible topics of interest--tagging posts
